README - Binary Search Tree Project

This project contains three Java classes that work together to implement and manage Binary Search Trees.

1. TreeNode.java
   - Represents a single node in a Binary Search Tree.
   - Stores an integer value and references to left and right children.
   - Basic building block for tree structure.

2. BinarySearchTree.java
   - Implements a standard Binary Search Tree.
   - Supports inserting values, counting nodes, and computing tree height.
   - Uses recursive helper methods to maintain BST ordering.

3. BinarySearchTreeCollection.java
   - Manages a collection of multiple Binary Search Trees.
   - Allows adding new trees and calculating total nodes across all trees.
   - Useful for working with several independent BSTs at once.

Features:
- Recursive insertion and height calculation.
- Simple node-based tree structure.
- Aggregation of multiple trees for combined statistics.
